I merge the dev branch into the master branch every weekend for any bug fixes/typos

The only times I will deviate from this schedule are when the following happens
1. There's a critical update that I need to push to the master branch ASAP
2. The dev branch is in a state of unstability (usually when I'm busy with an update)
